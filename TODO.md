# TODO list

## init

*   check input and output are directories
*   check if input or output folder exists with write permission

## conversion

*   check converted file after conversion
*   special character support (needs good testing)
*   if got timeout mutex, just stop that process?

## misc

*   add verbose for logging
*   explain usage of script and why I made it
*   send notification when done? (probably not. only on fail? hm....)
*   display process that will display the status/progress
